The `och` CLI is the fastest way to manage stacks, PRs, and queue workflows.

## Highlights

- Stack creation and submission (`och stack create`, `och stack submit`)
- Merge queue operations (`och queue add`, `och queue list`)
- AI review and approvals (`och review ai`, `och review approve`)
- Repository‑level automations (`och automate create`)
- Metrics and insights (`och metrics show`, `och insights team`)
