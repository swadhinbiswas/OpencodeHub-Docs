title: "Team Workflows"
---


OpenCodeHub supports various workflows to suit your team's size and velocity.

## 1. Feature Branch Workflow (Standard)

Best for: **Small Teams**, **Open Source**, **Linear History**

This is the classic workflow used by most teams on GitHub/GitLab.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    commit
    branch feature/login
    checkout feature/login
    commit id: "Dev 1"
    commit id: "Dev 2"
    checkout main
    merge feature/login
    commit id: "Release"
```

### The Process
1.  **Main Branch**: Always contains production-ready code.
2.  **Feature Branch**: Created from `main` for specific tasks (`feat/login`).
3.  **Pull Request**: Opened against `main`. Changes are reviewed.
4.  **Merge**: Once approved, squashed or merged into `main`.

## 2. Stacked PR Workflow (High Velocity)

Best for: **Large Teams**, **Complex Features**, **Fast Paced**

Instead of one massive PR, you break a feature into a chain of dependent PRs.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch feat/schema
    checkout feat/schema
    commit id: "DB Schema (PR#1)"
    branch feat/api
    checkout feat/api
    commit id: "API Layer (PR#2)"
    branch feat/ui
    checkout feat/ui
    commit id: "Login UI (PR#3)"
    checkout main
    merge feat/schema
    checkout feat/api
    merge main
    checkout feat/ui
    merge feat/api
```

### The Process
1.  **PR #1 (Schema)**: Base layer. Submitted for review.
2.  **PR #2 (API)**: Created from `feat/schema`. Submitted immediately.
3.  **PR #3 (UI)**: Created from `feat/api`. Submitted immediately.

**Benefits:**
- 🚀 **Zero Blocking**: Don't wait for PR #1 review to start PR #2.
- 📦 **Atomic Review**: Reviewers see small, logical changes.
- 🤖 **Auto-Rebase**: OpenCodeHub handles the complex Git operations automatically.

## 3. Gitflow (Legacy/Enterprise)

Best for: **Strict Release Cycles**, **Versioned Software**

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    branch feature/A
    commit
    checkout develop
    merge feature/A
    branch release/v1.0
    commit id: "Bump Version"
    checkout main
    merge release/v1.0 tag: "v1.0"
    checkout develop
    merge release/v1.0
```

### The Process
1.  **Main**: Only for official releases.
2.  **Develop**: Integration branch for next release.
3.  **Feature**: Created from `develop`.
4.  **Release**: Created from `develop` when feature-complete. Merged to `main` and `develop`.

## Choosing the Right Workflow

| Feature | Feature Branch | Stacked PRs | Gitflow |
|---------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| **Complexity** | Low | Medium | High |
| **Velocity** | Medium | High | Low |
| **Review Quality** | Low (Big PRs) | High (Small PRs) | Medium |
| **CI Cost** | Low | Low (Batched) | High |
