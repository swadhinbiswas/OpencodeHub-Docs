## 4. Root Cause

Explain the technical root cause in plain language. What actually broke, not just symptoms.

Example: A recent migration added a NOT NULL constraint to `workflow_secrets.encrypted_value` 
without a default, but existing rows had NULL values. On deploy, the constraint check failed, 
preventing the migration from running, leaving the app in a half-upgraded state.
